## DO auto create Immunizer CPU

- Open CPU.py
- Edit variable "a" to how many alloy you have.
- If you do not wish to do this you can also comment line **13**. > #cmax = a / b
- You can manually change the value of cpus to make by changing the value in line 10. > cmax = **newamount**
- Run the module

### NOTE: make sure the cpu.py and images folder are in the same destination.
